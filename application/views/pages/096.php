            <p>Questions 1-10</p>
            <p>Potash (the old name for potassium carbonate) is one of the two alkalis (the other being soda, sodium carbonate) that were used from remote antiquity in the making of glass, and from the early Middle Ages in the making of soap: the former being the product of heating a mixture of alkali and sand, Line <u><b>the latter</b></u> a product of alkali and vegetable oil. Their importance in the communities of colonial North America need hardly <u><b>be stressed</b></u>. </p>
            <p>Potash and soda are not <u><b>interchangeable</b></u> for all purposes, but for glass-or soap- making either would do. Soda was obtained largely from the ashes of certain Mediterranean sea plants, potash from those of inland vegetation. Hence potash was more familiar to the early European settlers of the North American continent. </p>
            <p>The settlement at Jamestown in Virginia was in many ways a microcosm of the economy of colonial North America, and potash was one of its first concerns. It was required for the glassworks, the first factory in the British colonies, and was produced in sufficient quantity to permit the inclusion of potash in the first cargo shipped out of Jamestown. The second ship to arrive in the settlement from England included among its passengers experts in potash making.</p>
            <p>The method of making potash was simple enough. Logs was piled up and burned in the open, and the ashes collected. The ashes were placed in a barrel with holes in the bottom, and water was poured over them. The solution draining from the barrel was boiled down in iron kettles. The resulting mass was further heated to fuse the mass into what was called potash. </p>
            <p>In North America, potash making quickly became an <u><b>adjunct</b></u> to the clearing of land for agriculture, for it was estimated that as much as half the cost of clearing land could be recovered by the sale of potash. Some potash was exported from Maine and New Hampshire in the seventeenth century, but the market turned out to be mainly domestic, consisting mostly of shipments from the northern to the southern colonies. For despite the beginning of the trade at Jamestown and such encouragements as a series of acts &quot;to encourage the making of potash,&quot; beginning in 1707 in South Carolina, the softwoods in the South proved to be poor sources of the substance</p>

            <p><b>Questions 11-21</b></p>
            <p>The first flying vertebrates were true reptiles in which one of the fingers of the front limbs becamevery elongated, providing support for a flap of stretched skin that served as a wing. These were the pterosaurs, <u><b>literally</b></u> the &quot;winged lizards.&quot; The earliest pterosaurs arose near the end of the Triassic period Line of the Mesozoic Era, some 70 million years before the first known fossils of true birds occur, and they presumably dominated the skies until they were eventually displaced by birds. Like the dinosaurs, some the pterosaurs became gigantic; the largest fossil discovered is of an individual that had a wingspan of 50 feet or more, larger than many <u><b>airplanes</b></u>. These flying reptiles had large, tooth-filled jaws, but their bodies were small and probably without the necessary powerful muscles for sustained wing movement. <u><b>They</b></u> must have been expert gliders, not skillful fliers, relying on wind power for their locomotion. </p>
            <p>Birds, despite sharing common reptilian ancestors with pterosaurs, evolved quite separately and have been much more successful in their dominance of the air. They are an example of a common theme in evolution, the more or less parallel development of different types of body structure and function for the same reason-in this case, for flight. Although the fossil record, as always, is not complete enough to determine definitively the evolutionary lineage of the birds or in as much detail as one would like, it is better in this case than for many other animal groups. That is because of the unusual preservation in a limestone quarry in southern Germany of Archaeopteryx, a fossil that many have called the link between dinosaurs and birds. Indeed, had it not been for the superb preservation of these fossils, they might well have been <u><b>classified</b></u> as dinosaurs. They have the skull and teeth of a reptile as well as a bony tail, but in the line-grained limestone in which these fossils occur there are delicate impressions of feathers and fine details of bone structure that make it clear that Archaeopteryx was a bird. All birds living today, from the great condors of the Andes to the tiniest wrens, race their origin back to the Mesozoic dinosaurs.</p>

            <p><b>Questions 22-31</b></p>
            <p>In July of 1994, an astounding series of events took place. The world anxiously watched as, every few hours, a hurtling chunk of comet plunged into the atmosphere of Jupiter. All of the twenty-odd fragments, <u><b>collectively</b></u> called comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 after its discoverers, were once part of the same Line object, now dismembered and strung out along the same orbit. This cometary train, glistening like a string of pearls, had been first glimpsed only a few months before its fateful impact with Jupiter, and rather quickly scientists had predicted that the fragments were on a collision course with the giant planet. The impact caused an explosion clearly visible from Earth, a bright flaming fire that quickly expanded as each icy mass <u><b>incinerated</b></u> it self. When each fragment slammed at 60 kilometers per second into the dense atmosphere, its immense kinetic energy was transformed into heat, producing a superheated fireball that was ejected back through the tunnel the fragment had made a few seconds earlier.</p>
            <p>The residues from these explosions left huge black marks on the face of Jupiter, some of which have stretched out to form dark ribbons. Although this impact event was of considerable scientific import, it especially piqued public curiosity and interest. Photographs of each collision made the evening television newscast and were posted on the Internet. This was possibly the most open scientific endeavor in history. The face of the largest planet in the solar system was changed before our very eyes. And for the very first time, most of humanity came to fully appreciate the fact that we ourselves live on a similar <u><b>target</b></u>, a world subject to catastrophe by random assaults from celestial bodies. That realization was a surprise to many, but it should not have been. One of the great truths revealed by the last few decades of planetary exploration is that collisions between bodies of all sizes are relatively commonplace, at least in geologic terms, and were even more frequent in the early solar system.</p>

            <p><b>Questions 32-42</b></p>
            <p>The year 1850 may be considered the beginning of a new epoch in America art, with respect to the development of watercolor painting. In December of that year, a group of thirty artists gathered in the studio of John Falconer in New York City and drafted both a constitution and bylaws, establishing The Line Society for the Promotion of Painting in Water Color. In addition to <u><b>securing</b></u> an exhibition space in the Library Society building in lower Manhattan, the society founded a small school for the instruction of watercolor painting Periodic exhibitions of the members' paintings also included works by noted English artists of the day, borrowed from embryonic private collections in the city. </p>
            <p>The society's activities also included organized sketching excursions along he Hudson River, Its major public exposure came in 1853, when the society presented works by its members in the &quot;Industry of All Nations&quot; section of the Crystal Palace Exposition in New York. The society did not prosper, however, and by the time of its annual meeting in 1854 membership had fallen to twenty-one. The group gave up its quarters in the Library Society building and returned to Falconer's studio, where it broke up amid dissension. No further attempt to formally organize the growing numbers of watercolor painters in New York City was made for more than a decade. During that decade, though, Henry Warren's Painting in Water Color was published in New York City in 1856-the book was a <u><b>considerable</b></u> improvement over the only other manual of instruction existing at the time, Elements of Graphic Art, by Archibald Roberson, published in 1802 and by the 1850's long out of print. </p>
            <p>In 1866 the National Academy of Design was host to an exhibition of watercolor painting in its elaborate neo-Venetian Gothic building on Twenty-Third Street in New York City. The exhibit was sponsored by an independent group called The Artists Fund Society. Within a few months of this event, forty-two <u><b>prominent</b></u> artists living in and near New York City founded The American Society of Painters in Water colors.</p>

            <p><b>Questions 43-50</b></p>
            <p>Pennsylvania's colonial ironmasters forged iron and a revolution that had both industrial and political <u><b>implications</b></u>. The colonists in North America wanted the right to the profits gained from their manufacturing. However, England wanted all of the colonies' rich ores and raw materials to feed its own Line factories, and also wanted the colonies to be a market for its finished goods. England passed legislation in 1750 to prohibit colonists from making finished iron products, but by 1771, when entrepreneur Mark Bird established the Hopewell blast furnace in Pennsylvania, iron making had become the backbone of American industry. It also had become one of the major issues that fomented the revolutionary break between England and the British colonies. By the time the War of Independence broke out in 1776, Bird, angered and determined, was manufacturing cannons and shot at Hopewell to be used by the  Continental Army.</p>
            <p>After the war, Hopewell, along with hundreds of other &quot;iron plantations,&quot; continued to form the new nation's industrial foundation well into the nineteenth century. The rural landscape became dotted with tall stone pyramids that breathed flames and smoke, charcoal-fueled iron furnaces that produced the versatile metal so crucial to the nation's growth,. Generations of ironmasters, craftspeople, and workers produced goods during war and peace-ranging from cannons and shot to domestic items such as cast-iron stoves, pots, and sash weights for windows. </p>
            <p>The region around Hopewell had everything needed for iron production: a wealth of iron ore near the surface, limestone for removing impurities from the iron, hardwood forests to supply the charcoal used for fuel, <u><b>rushing</b></u> water to power the bellows that pumped blasts of air into the furnace fires, and workers to supply the labor. By the 1830's, Hopewell had developed a reputation for producing high quality cast-iron stoves, for which there was a steady market. As Pennsylvania added more links to its transportation system of <u><b>roads, canals, and railroads</b></u>, it became easier to ship parts made by Hopewell workers to sites all over the east coast. There <u><b>they</b></u> were assembled into stoves and sold from Rhode Island to Maryland as the &quot;Hopewell stove&quot;. By the time the last fires burned out at Hopewell ironworks in 1883, the community had produced <u><b>some</b></u> 80,000 cast-iron stoves.</p>
