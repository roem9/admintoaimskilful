            <p>Questions 1-5</p>
            <p>People living today in the northwestern state of Washington who have many sources of news in addition to newspapers must stretch their imaginations to understand the importance of the press during much of the state's history. Beginning in 1852 with The Cohumblan. the first paper in Washington Line Territory, ,lewspapers served to connect settlers in frontier communities with each other and with the major events of their times.</p>
            <p>Unlike many mid-century papers, The Columbian, published every Saturday in Olympia, one of Washington's larger towns, was &quot;neutral in politics,&quot; meaning that <b>it</b> was not the organ of a particular political party or religious group. For its first few years, it was the only newspaper in the territory, but during the following decades, enterprising Washingtonians founded many other papers. Few of these papers lasted long. Until the turn of the century, most were the production of an individual editor, who might begin with insufficient capital or fail to attract a steady readership. Often working with no staff at all, these editors wrote copy, set type, <b>delivered</b> papers <b>oversaw</b>, billing, and sold advertising. Their highly personal journals reflected their own tastes, politics, and known as the &quot;Oregon style&quot;-graphic, torrid, and potentially libelous. </p>
            <p>Early newspapers were thick with print, carrying no illustrations or cartoons. Advertising was generally confined to the back pages and simply listed commodities received by local stores, Toward the end of the century, newspapers in Washington began to carry national advertising, especially from patent medicine companies, which bought space from agencies that brokered ads in papers all over the country. By 1900, Washington <b>boasted</b> 19 daily and 176 weekly papers. Especially in the larger cities, they reflected less the personal opinions of the editor than the interests of the large businesses they had become. They subscribed to the Associated Press and United Press news services, and new technology permitted illustrations. Concentrating on features, crime reporting, and sensationalism, they imitated the new mass-circulation papers that William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer were making popular throughout the United States.</p>

            <p>Questions 10-16</p>
            <p>Europa is the smallest of planet Jupiter's four largest moons and the second moon out from Jupiter. Until 1979, it was just another astronomy textbook statistic. Then came the close-up images obtained by the exploratory spacecraft Voyager 2, and within days, Europa was transformed-in our perception, Line at least-into one of the solar system's most <b>intriguing</b> worlds. The biggest initial surprise was the ahnost total lack of detail, especially from far away. Even at close range, the only visible features are thin, kinked brown lines resembling <b>cracks in an eggshell</b>. And <b>this analogy is not far offthe mark</b>.</p>
            <p>The surface of Europa is almost pure water ice, but a nearly complete absence of craters indicates that Europa's surface ice resembles Earth's Antarctic ice cap. The eggshell analogy may be quite accurate since the ice could be as little as a few kilometers thick a tree shell around what is likely a subsurface liquid ocean that, in turn, encases a rocky core. The interior of Europa has been kept warm over the cons by tidal forces generated by the varying gravitational tugs of the other big moons as they wheel around Jupiter. The tides on Europa pull and relax in an <b>endless</b> cycle. The resulting internal heat keeps what would otherwise be ice melted almost to the surface. The cracklike marks on Europa's icy face appear to be fractures where water or slush oozes from below. </p>
            <p>Soon after Voyager 2's encounter with Jupiter in 1979, when the best images of Europa were obtained, researchers advanced the startling idea that Europa's subsurface ocean might harbor life. Life processes could have begun when Jupiter was releasing a vast store of internal heat. Jupiter's early heat was produced by the compression of the material forming the giant planet. Just as the Sun is far less radiant today than the primal Sun, so the internal heat generated by Jupiter is minor compared to its former intensity. During this warm phase, some 4.6 billion years ago, Europa's ocean may have been liquid right to the surface, making <b>it</b> a crucible for life.</p>

            <p>Questions 20-26</p>
            <p>The term &quot;print&quot; has several meanings, so it is important to understand exactly what is meant by the artistic terminology. A print in the artistic sense is not a reproduction of a work of art done in some other medium, such as painting or drawing. <b>That</b> can in no sense be considered a work of art, since Line the artist had no involvement with it. A print is an original work of art created by an indirect method. Instead of making an image directly on a surface, as in drawing or painting, the artist works on a master surface, which may be a sheet of metal, a block of stone, wood, plastic, or linoleum. From this master surface, numerous <b>impressions</b> may be made by inking the surface, laying a sheet of paper on it, and then subjecting both surface and paper to pressure, generally by means of a printing press. </p>
            <p>A print may exist in several <b>versions</b>. Sometimes the printmaker alters the image between impressions, so that each print is slightly different from the others. Any series of such prints is referred to as <b>multiples</b>. The number of impressions (known as the edition) that are possible from a single original varies with the material. Prints made from linoleum, which wears readily, will be fewer than those made from a metal plate, which is capable of striking fine-quality prints in the thousands. <b>It is customary</b> to number prints as they come off the press, the earlier impressions being the finest and therefore the most desirable. </p>
            <p>Prints incorporate the same compositional principles, as paintings. Line, shape, or texture maybe the predominant element according to the printing technique used. Some prints have obvious decorative qualities while others may be filled with emotional impact. Printmaking derives from two historical sources: early woodblocks into which an image was cut and used to illustrate a book or playing cards, and the medieval practice of decorating metal with incised designs, as in armor. Today most techniques fall into one of four categories: relief( intaglio, lithography, and serigraphy. However, there are many variations, combinations with photographic techniques, and considerable overlapping.</p>

            <p>Questions 29-38</p>
            <p>Water projects in the United States gained a new rationale in the 1930's as the nation suffered its worst cconomic depression and the Great Plains region suffered its worst drought in recorded history. As the economy sank into a deep depression and unemployment rates increased, the political climate Line for direct federal govermnent involvement in water projects improved. President Franklin Rooseveh's first 100 days in office brought a number of new laws to deal with the severe economic depression that became known as the Great Depression. Two of these laws, the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 and the National Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA), had particular <b>significance</b> for water resource development.</p>
            <p>The natural pattern of the Tennessee River was characterized by large spring flows that produced destructive floods and low summer flows that inhibited navigation. The intensily and frequency of the events discouraged development and contributed to persistent poverty in the valley. <b>To counter</b> these natural obstacles, the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 created the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a public agency with broad powers to promote development in the region, including the <b>authority</b> to build dams and reservoirs and to generate and sell hydroelectric power. The TVA is a unique institution in that it brings all the water-related functions of the federal government under a single body. The TVA used its authority to <b>transform</b> the Tennessee River into one of the most highly regulated rivers in the world within about two decades. The TVA inherited the Wilson Dam, and by the beginning of the Second World War it had completed six additional multipurpose dams with power plants and locks for navigation. Investments in dams and hydropower.</p>
            <p>facilities within the Tennessee Valley also received high priority during the war. The NIRA authorized the creation of the Public Works Administration to create jobs while undertaking work of benefit to the community. The NIRA also gave the United States President s powers to initiate public works, including water projects. The Public Works Administration provided loans and grants to state and local governments and to federal agencies for municipal waterworks, sewage plants, irrigation, flood control, and waterpower projects.</p>

            <p>Questions 40-50</p>
            <p>Many of the most flexible examples of tool use in animals come from primates (the order that includes humans, apes, and monkeys). For example, many wild primates use objects to threaten outsiders. But there are many examples of tool use by other mammals, as well as by birds and other types of animals. </p>
            <p>Tools are used by many species in the capture or preparation of food. Chimpanzees use sticks and poles to bring out ants and <b>termites</b> from their hiding places. Among the most complex tool use observed in the wild is the use of stones by Ivory Coast chimpanzees to crack nuts open. They select a large flat stone as an anvil (a heavy block on which to place the nuts) and a smaller stone as a hammer. Stones suitable for use as anvils are not easy to find, and often a chimpanzee may carry a <b>haul</b> of nuts more than 40 meters to find a suitable anvil. The use of tools in chimpanzees is especially interesting because these animals sometimes modify tools to make <b>them</b> better suited for their intended purpose. To make a twig more effective for digging out termites, for example, a chimp may first <b>strip</b> it of its leaves. </p>
            <p>Surprisingly, there is also a species of bird that uses sticks to probe holes in the search for insects. One of the species of Galapagos finch, the woodpecker finch, picks up or breaks off a twig, cactus spine, or leaf stem. This primitive tool is then held in the beak and used to probe for insects in holes in trees that the bird cannot probe directly with its beak. Birds have been seen to carry twigs from tree to tree searching for prey. Tools may also be used for defense. Hermit crabs grab sea anemones with their claws and use them as weapons to repel their enemies. Studies have demonstrated that these crabs significantly improve their chances against predators such as octopus by means of this tactic. Also, many species of forest-dwelling primates defend themselves by throwing objects, including stones, at intruders.</p>
